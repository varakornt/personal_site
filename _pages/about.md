My name is Varakorn. I enjoy learning Computer Science and work on random projects. Some of my hobbies are reading biographies, playing videogames, procrastinating, and browsing the web. I'm currently interested in learning more about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Robotics. I still have so much to learn and I will be documenting some of my side projects here. Have a great day!
