This page covers the certifications I have taken and I will be sharing my experiences on what I did to study in order to pass the exams.

### CompTIA

The Trifecta CompTIA certifications (A+, Network+, and Security+) cover basics IT, networking, and security fundamentals. These certifications are the most common and recommended entry level certs for going into the IT and Cybersecurity field. Some of the contents from these three certs will overlap each other especially with the more advanced onces that CompTIA offers as it builds upon the basics and go a bit more in depth.

#### Intermediate Certifications
CompTIA Linux+, Cloud+, PenTest+, and CySA+

#### Advanced Certifications
CompTIA CASP+

This certification is the hardest cert available from CompTIA! This cert covers lots of different topics from many other CompTIA certs. So I would certainly save this for last as it builds off a lot of the knowledge from previous certs.


#### CompTIA Certifications Pyramid Structure
Most CompTIA Certifications expires three years the date after it is earned. Exception includes: Linux+, Project+, and Server+. But! CompTIA let's us renew an active certs only if the cert being earn is of higher level in the pyramid. So if I took Security+ a year ago and was able to pass CySA+ recently, my active Security+ would also get its date renew to the new CySA expiration date. Awesome!
